            <h3>Step 1. Acquire Contabo VPS</h3>
            <p>Everyone knows that <a href="https://contabo.com/">Contabo</a> is the number one source of premium virtual private servers (and also the cheapest).</p>
            <p>Find the nearest credit card from your parent's wallets and buy yourself a server. Look for the one with the most ram as that will enable you to sell the most servers.</p>
            <p>When ordering, be sure to install Ubuntu 14.04, because 16.04 and 18.04 are newer, thus consuming more of your valuable RAM. We can't have that. Plus, our game server panel is fully compatable with 14.04.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 2. Install Nulled WHMCS</h3>
            <p>You're currently in the "testing phase", which means you have an excuse for using a nulled copy of WHMCS. Google "Nulled WHMCS" and click the first link that looks appealing.</p>
            <p>Hopefully the website you're looking for has a shoutbox or chat, which means you can have people guide you through the entire install, including the part where ionCube doesn't work.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 3. Install Pterodacley</h3>
            <p>Pterodactylylee is the most important part of this, since it's where you'll be hosting all of your servers. We reccomend Pterodactil, for it's ability to run more than one type of gameserver, and most importantly, it's free.</p>
            <p>You can head over to <a href="https://pterodactyl.io">pterodacly.io</a> and click the Discord button, where you can proceed to spam #support and call the panel trash to get people to help you install it. This is the most crucial step so do
              it carefully.</p>
            <p><b>Warning:</b> If anyone tells you to remove the default nginx config, whatever that is, don't remove it as you'll need it for your website to work properly.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 4. Link WHMCS to Pterodacley</h3>
            <p>You don't want to create servers manually do you? Neither do I. Luckily for you, there's a <b>free</b> WHMCS module available for hosts just like yours! Head into the #whmcs channel in the Pterodactyl Discord server you joined earlier and
              spam until someone sends you the download link.</p>
            <p>Once you've done that, hire a sysadmin on <a href="https://mc-market.org">MC-Market</a> to install it for you because you're "too lazy". Once you find someone that's willing to install it for $0.43, you can proceed to the next step.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 5. Download a template</h3>
            <p>Since no one actually wants to code a website, have a look around <a href="https://themeforest.net">Themeforest</a> and find a minecraft hosting template that looks good.</p>
            <p>Wait, WTF? This template is $9? You can't afford that! You're still in the "testing phase"! Google "Themeforest <code>Template Name Here</code> Template Nulled" and download them one by one until it doesn't give you a virus. Upload it to your
              default nginx directory, <code>/var/www/html/</code>, and edit away with notepad!</p>
            <p><b>Word of Advice:</b> Some people may suggest to use something along the lines of Atom or VSCode for editing your template. Ignore them, Notepad is the fastest and most efficient editor on the market currently, and it's built into Windows!</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 5 1/2. Customize your template</h3>
            <p>The cheaper your services, the better, but you still want to make a profit. Since you're not a registered host and are still in the "testing phase", which means you don't have to pay taxes, I recommend starting at $0.99/GB for base pricing,
              to attract any potential customers that may have a sensitive budget.</p>
            <p>Be sure to also advertise your node specs boldly on the front page, and the DDoS protection that you definently have. Also, I would exaggerate the node specs so customers can proudly show off what they bought and don't think you're overselling, creating a sense
              of pride and satisfaction.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 6. Get a domain</h3>
            <p>Every host has to have a domain to look good. You wouldn't want a free subdomain like <code>explosivehosting.weebly.com</code> for your hosting would you?</p>
            <p>You're going to need one of your parent's credit card again for this step. Head over to <a href="https://namecheap">Namecheap</a> and pick up yourself a .host domain, you can pick whatever you want. It's only $1 for the first year, so they
              probably won't notice it go through. <b>Be sure to enable auto-renewal for the domain so it won't suddenly stop working.</b> Not like you're gonna be charged $70 after that or anything.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 7. Offer Discord Support</h3>
            <p>WHMCS Tickets can be slow and annoying for customers, be sure to create a Discord server and offer support there.</p>
            <p><b>Word of Advice:</b> You may want to mute the support channel in your server as the constant pinging can get annoying while you're in school or watching YouTube.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 8. Advertise your host</h3>
            <p>Now that you've got yourself a genuine Summer Host&trade;, it's time to advertise it on <a href="https://mc-market.org">MC-Market</a>, the same place you hired your sysadmin from earlier.</p>
            <p>Before you do that though, you should hire a graphic designer from MC-Market to make you a cool thread template design, and then do a paypal chargeback afterwards. They don't really need the money at all, trust me.</p>
            <p>To get the most clients, search for "minecraft server" in the search bar, and rapidly copy/paste your thread template <s>you paid for</s> you got earlier into the reply box on the page.</p>
            <p>You may also want to go into the Hosting - Offering category and paste it there as well for maximum effectiveness.</p>
            <br>

            <h3>Step 9. Defend your host</h3>
            <p>You may receive some backlash from the community in the form of negative reputation and namecalling.</p>
            <p>The hosting market is like the battlefield, you've gotta kill or get killed. Be sure to deflect anything they throw at you with insults, personal attacks (recommended), DDoS attacks, and other things that may want to make them cry. Offer to
              1v1 them IRL too, that usually shuts them up pretty quickly.</p>
            <p>A good example of someone doing this properly and effectively can be seen below:</p>

            <p class="text-muted">A "Summer Host" is a hosting company that someone's trying to start that's usually not a legally registered business, has bad business practices, uses nulled billing systems, or just low effort in general. They usually have an average lifespan
              of a couple months, and are mostly out to appeal towards the low budget audience (mostly made of kids) for hosting in order to make a quick buck or two. </p>
